#Potato Land Adventure (2014)
Embark on a journey through the quirky world I coded into existence as a *budding* developer.

#What is it?
A text-based game coded by a younger me, complete with all the whimsy and chaos of learning something new. It's unpolished, barbarically implemented, and packed with my early attempts at game design working in Python.

#Why share?
Because progress is a potato that grows with time! This game is a time capsule with a dash of cringe and a sprinkle of dark humor. It reflects a different time and shows how far I've come.

#Try it out
Dive in, make choices, try not to get eaten by lions or potatoes. Enjoy the ride â€“ and the evolution of a developer!

I'll have a demo link here whenever I get one set up: Nope not yet
